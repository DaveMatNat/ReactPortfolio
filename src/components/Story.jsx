                <p className="mb-5 text-base sm:text-xl">
                    I was born on the tropical island of Phuket, Thailand. My journey took a wild turn early on, 
                    when my family migrated to Chiang Mai and moved into a sprawling wooden teak mansion—once
                    owned by a notorious drug lord kingpin. My parents had beaten the police
                    to secure it in a high-stakes bid, and that house became the backdrop of
                    my childhood. I grew up in the countryside, surrounded by nature, hill
                    tribes, and stories as vivid as the mountains themselves. As a
                    Thai–American boy, I didn’t know it then, but those early years gave me a
                    lens that would shape everything: an appreciation for different worlds,
                    and a hunger to see beyond my own.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-5 text-base sm:text-xl">
                    Before I ever wrote a line of code, my world revolved around
                    editing videos, losing myself in Minecraft, and
                    dreaming of building a presence that could inspire and influence others
                    online. But somewhere in that journey, curiosity began to itch. I wanted
                    to understand the machine itself, the inner workings behind the tools I
                    was using. One day, I cracked open a Java file—only to find a wall of
                    code that felt like a foreign language. I didn’t understand a thing… but
                    a seed was planted. That incomprehensible screen wasn’t a barrier. It was
                    an invitation.

                <p className='text-base sm:text-xl'>
                    I followed that pull. I discovered Python, then wandered deeper into the
                    world of machine learning and data science. Suddenly, the tools I once
                    used passively became canvases I could shape myself. I could automate,
                    analyze, and build. My projects grew from simple experiments to AI
                    models, bots, and full-fledged applications. The boy in a teak mansion
                    surrounded by mountains had found a new landscape—one made of logic,
                    data, and limitless possibility. And this is just the beginning.
