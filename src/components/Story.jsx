                <p className="mb-5 text-base sm:text-xl">
                    I was born on the island of Phuket, Thailand. When I was young, my family
                    moved north to Chiang Mai and into a wooden teak mansion. It used to belong
                    to a drug kingpin, and somehow my parents managed to get it before the police did.
                    That house became the backdrop of my childhood: wooden hallways, wild animals, and hill tribes.

                <p className="mb-5 text-base sm:text-xl">
                    My dad was born in Brooklyn, NY, and my mom was born in Phatthalung, Thailand. With an American dad and Thai mom, both English and Thai were spoken at home, making me a personal translator for my family. I helped my father, who doesn't speak Thai, navigate the social world in Chiang Mai, which taught me both how to bridge gaps between people and the importance of communication. These lessons have stuck with me, and I continue to use them in my everyday life.

                <p className="mb-5 text-base sm:text-xl">
                    Along the way, I built a philosophy that still guides me. I believe in the little things,
                    the small details that add up quickly and create real impact. I believe in kindness and forgiveness,
                    and that learning is something you do every single day. Even small improvements matter.
                    The Japanese call it "Kaizen" aka continuous improvement. If I can get just a little better each day,
                    I know the bigger picture will take care of itself.
                </p>

                <p className="mb-5 text-base sm:text-xl">
                    Before I ever touched code, I was glued to editing videos, playing way too much
                    Minecraft and Overwatch, and daydreaming about building something people online would
                    actually care about. Then one day, curiosity hit. I opened up a random Java file,
                    saw symbols that made no sense, and instead of closing it I got
                    hooked.

                <p className='text-base sm:text-xl'>
                    That was the start of a world of limitless possibilities. I began with Python, and from there the rabbit hole opened
                    into machine learning, data science, and automation. The things I used to only
                    consume became things I could build myself. Little scripts grew into bigger
                    projects: AI models, bots, and apps that actually worked. The kid running around
                    that teak mansion eventually found a new playground, one made of logic and creativity
                    instead of wood and stone. And honestly, I’m still just getting started.
